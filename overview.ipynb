    "### What is asyncio?\n",
    "\n",
    "`Asyncio` is a tool in Python that helps you handle tasks like network calls or file operations without making your program wait around doing nothing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of pausing while waiting for a response, `asyncio` lets your program jump to other tasks, making everything run smoothly on a single thread.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like having a smart helper that knows when to switch tasks so nothing gets stuck waiting.\n"

    "### Coroutine in Python\n",
    "A `coroutine` is a special type of function in Python that can **pause and resume** its execution. It’s mainly used in `asyncio` for handling asynchronous tasks efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, instead of waiting for a slow task to finish (like downloading a file), a coroutine lets the program switch to another task and come back later when the file is ready.\n"

    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coroutines**  \n",
    "   Think of these as “special” functions defined with `async def`. They can **pause** whenever they need to wait for something (using `await`) and let other tasks run in the meantime. Coroutines are the heart of `asyncio`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Event Loop**  \n",
    "   Imagine an orchestra conductor who decides which musician plays and when. The event loop is just like that conductor.it manages all the tasks and decides which coroutine should run at any given moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tasks**  \n",
    "   A task is basically a wrapper around a coroutine. When you create a task, you’re telling the event loop to schedule that coroutine to run in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Futures**  \n",
    "   A future is like a placeholder for a result that isn’t ready yet. Once the result is available, the future is updated. Tasks are built on top of futures, so they work hand in hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Awaitables**  \n",
    "   These are things you can “wait on” with the `await` keyword—typically coroutines, tasks, or futures. When you `await` something, your code pauses until that thing is done, then picks up right where it left off.\n",
    "\n"
